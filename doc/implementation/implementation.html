    <h1>Spring++ Implementation</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        This picture shows the most important classes of Spring++ and their relations:
    </p>

    <h2>Primitives</h2>

    <p>
    Graphics code operates on basic primitives such as points, sizes, vectors and rectangles:
    </p>

    <img src="../image/primitives.png"/>

    <h2>GDI+</h2>

    <p>
        Spring++ uses the Microsoft GDI+ graphics library (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-gdi-start)
        that contains a rich set of drawing components.
        Spring++ uses only a subset of those:

    <h2>Diagram Elements</h2>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">DiagramElement</span> class is the base class of all diagram elements. Each element has a bounding rectangle and a name.
        All elements can measure their dimensions, draw themselves to the graphics surface, clone themselves,
        return their attributes as XML and parse the attributes back from XML:
    </p>

    <h2>Layout</h2>

    <p>
        Layout contain subdimensions, colors, fonts and paddings of diagram elements.
        The unit of measure of all layout elements is millimeter.
        The layout is saved as XML to the <span class="bold">layout.xml</span> file 
        located in the <span class="bold">layout</span> subdirectory of the 
        <span class="bold">springpp</span> directory.
    </p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        This picture contains the layout classes:
    </p>

    <img src="../image/layout_overview.png"/>

    <h3>Fundamental Layout Elements</h3>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">LayoutElement</span> class is the base class of all layout elements.
        Each layout element has a name, can return its attributes as XML and parse attributes back from XML.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fundamental layout elements contain color, font and padding attributes:
    </p>

    <img src="../image/fundamental_layout_elements.png"/>

    <h3>Container Layout Elements</h3>

    <p>
        The container layout elements contain the line widths, colors, fonts and paddings of the 
        class, object and note diagram elements:
    </p>

    <img src="../image/container_layout_elements.png"/>

    <h3>Other Layout Elements</h3>

    <p>
        The rest layout elements contains the widths, heights, radii, colors, fonts and paddings of
        the rest of diagram elements:
    </p>

    <img src="../image/other_layout_elements.png"/>

    <h2>Helper Classes</h2>

    <img src="../image/helpers.png"/>

    <h3>Connector</h3>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">Connector</span> class represents an ID of an endpoint of a container class.
        Each container object has twelve endpoints, three on each side of the container object.
        In addition a class element has one endpoint for each operation and attribute, and 
        an object element has one endpoint for each attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary connector point specifies the side of the container element: 
        <span class="bold">left</span>, <span class="bold">top</span>, <span class="bold">right</span>, or <span class="bold">bottom</span>,
        or it can be <span class="bold">operation</span> or <span class="bold">attribute</span>.
        The secondary connector point specifies one of the three points: left and right sides have 
        <span class="bold">top</span>, <span class="bold">center</span> and <span class="bold">bottom</span> points,
        and the top and bottom sides have <span class="bold">left</span>, <span class="bold">center</span> and <span class="bold">right</span> points.
        If the primary point is <span class="bold">operation</span> or <span class="bold">attribute</span> the secondary point is the 
        index of the corresponding operation or attribute in a container element.
    </p>

    <h3>EndPoint</h3>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">EndPoint</span> class represents an endpoint of a relationship element.
        It has a reference to a diagram element, that is a container element, an operation element or an attribute element.
        It has also a connector, a calculated canvas point, two text elements and an index of a container element in a diagram.
        The primary text element contains the text drawn above the relationship line and
        the secondary text element contains the text drawn below the relationship line.
    </p>

    <h3>IndexList</h3>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">IndexList</span> is a class template that is specialized for the 
        <span class="bold">DiagramElement</span>,  <span class="bold">AttributeElement</span> or  <span class="bold">OperationElement</span>.
        The IndexList owns its elements. The elements are referenced by their index in the list.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    The <span class="bold">Configuration</span> class is a singleton that holds a <span class="bold">Layout</span> object.
    It is used by the diagram elements to access the layout.

    <h2>Container Elements</h2>

    <img src="../image/container_element.png"/>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">ContainerElement</span> class contains references to relationships that
        the container element is part of.
        When the location or size of the container element changes its <span class="bold">Measure</span> 
        method will be called. It calculates new source and target points for the relationships.
    </p>

    <h3>Class Element</h3>

    <img src="../image/class_element.png"/>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">ClassElement</span> class contains an <span class="bold">isAbstract</span> flag 
        that tells whether the class is abstract or not. When the isAbstract flag is changed, the 
        <span class="bold">rep</span> member is also changed to a new instance of 
        <span class="bold">ConcreteClassElement</span> or <span class="bold">AbstractClassElement</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The measuring and drawing of the class element is delegated to the representation class.
        The <span class="bold">GetClassLayout</span> method of the representation
        returns an instance of the  <span class="bold">ConcreteClassLayoutElement</span> or  <span class="bold">AbstractClassLayoutElement</span> 
        depending whether the representation is concrete or abstract. The font style of the caption in the concrete layout is bold and 
        in the abstract layout it is bold italic.
    </p>

    <h3>Object Element</h3>

    <img src="../image/object_element.png"/>

    <P>
        The <span class="bold">ObjectElement</span> class is simpler than the class element. The <span class="bold">DrawFrame</span> method draws a
        rounded rectangle frame to the object element.
    </P>

    <h3>Note Element</h3>

    <img src="../image/note_element.png"/>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">NoteElement</span> class has a vector of text lines. The <span class="bold">Draw</span> method 
        draws a frame with a note corner bitmap and calls the graphics.DrawString() method to draw the text lines.
    </p>

    <h2>Child Elements</h2>

    <p>
        Instances of the <span class="bold">AttributeElement</span> class are  contained by object or class elements.
        Instances of the <span class="bold">OperationElement</span> class are contained by class elements.
        Attributes and operations have a reference to their container element and they may be part of a relationship.
    </p>

    <img src="../image/child_elements.png"/>

    <h2>Relationships</h2>

    <h3>Relationship Element</h3>

    <img src="../image/relationship_element.png"/>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">RelationshipElement</span> class represents a relationship between two container elements.
        It has <span class="bold">rkind</span> member that is the kind of relationship represented,
        <span class="bold">cardinality</span> that holds the cardinality of the relationship, 
        <span class="bold">source</span> and <span class="bold">target</span> endpoints and 
        a vector of <span class="bold">routing points</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the <span class="bold">rkind</span> member changes, the <span class="bold">SetRep</span> method is called to 
        create a new instance of relationship representation and set it as the value of the <span class="bold">rep</span> member.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">Measure</span> method calculates the sizes of primary and secondary text elements for the 
        source and target endpoints, and then calls the <span class="bold">SetTextLocations</span> method to
        set new locations for those text elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Inheritance Relationship</h3>

    <img src="../image/inheritance_relationship.png"/>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">Inheritance</span> class is an example of a concrete relationship.
        The <span class="bold">Draw</span> method draws a line from the 
        starting point of the inheritance arrow to the first routing point of the inheritance.
        Then it draws the line from the previous routing point to the next routing point in turn.
        Finally it calculates the points of the lines that consist the target end of the inheritance arrow and draws the lines.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the rest of the concrete releationships, the implementations are analogous.
    </p>

    <h2>Text Element</h2>

    <img src="../image/text_element.png"/>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">TextElement</span> represents text drawn above or below a relationship line segment
        either near to the source or target endpoint of the relationship.
        If the <span class="bold">tkind</span> is <span class="bold">primaryText</span> the text is 
        drawn above the line segment, and if it is <span class="bold">secondaryText</span> the text is drawn below the line segment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">SetSourceLocation</span> and <span class="bold">SetTargetLocation</span> methods
        calculate the location of the text element for the source and target endpoints respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example of the location calculation code for the  <span class="bold">SetPrimarySourceLocation</span>
        is shown. In this case the <span class="bold">line</span> parameter is the starting line segment of the relationship line.
        First the line segment is converted to a vector <span class="bold">u</span>.
        Then the code branches depending on the quarter of the circle the vector u points to.
        The code is shown when the angle of the vector is between 0&#176 and 90&#176. Spring++ follows a common convention of 
        graphics systems that the x axis points to the right and the y axis points down. 
        Thus the <span class="bold">x_unit</span> and <span class="bold">y_unit</span> vectors are set accordingly.
        The variable <span class="bold">h</span> is set as the height of the bounding rectangle of the text element.
    </p>

    <p>
        The code is based on vector mathematics and geometry, specifically properties of similar right triangles.
    </p>

    <p>
        The calculations for other quarters of the circle are analogous but differ slightly.
    </p>

    <h2>Undo and Redo</h2>

    <p>
        To support undo and redo, user actions are captured as <span class="bold">Command</span>s and saved to a 
        <span class="bold">CommandList</span>. The command list is owned by the <span class="bold">Diagram</span> class.
    </p>

    <img src="../image/command.png"/>

    <h3>Command List</h3>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">CommandList</span> class holds commands and keeps track of current command index.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">AddCommand</span> method calls the <span class="bold">Finalize</span> method 
        of the command and saves the command to the current index position, or adds the command to the 
        end of the command list, if the current index is equal to the number of commands in the list.
        Then the current index is incremented and the list is resized to hold exactly current index number of commands.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">CanUndo</span> method returns <span class="bold">true</span> if the current command index is positive and 
        <span class="bold">false</span> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">Undo</span> method decrements the current command index and then calls the <span class="bold">Undo</span> method of the command at the 
        current command index.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">CanRedo</span> method returns <span class="bold">true</span> if the current command index is less then the 
        number of commands in the list and <span class="bold">false</span> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">Redo</span> method calls the <span class="bold">Redo</span> method of the command at the current command index, and increments the 
        current command index.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="bold">CanUndo</span> and <span class="bold">CanRedo</span> methods are used to enable and disable the <span class="bold">Undo</span> and
        <span class="bold">Redo</span> menu items respectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Selections</h2>

    <p>
        There are three kind of selections derived from the <span class="bold">Selection</span> base class: 
        the <span class="bold">EmptySelection</span> is the default when nothing is selected,
        the <span class="bold">ElementSelection</span> contains indeces of diagram elements selected by <span class="bold">control+clicking</span> them,
        and the <span class="bold">RectangleSelection</span> is created by dragging a rectangle around diagram elements.
    </p>

    <img src="../image/selection.png"/>

    <h2>Context Menu Actions</h2>

    <p>
        Actions are added to a context menu when user <span class="bold">right-clicks</span> either an individual diagram element or a selection.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Diagram Element Actions
    </h3>

    <p>
        Actions derived from the <span class="bold">DiagramElementAction</span> are added to a context menu by the <span class="bold">AddActions</span> method of a diagram element 
        when it is <span class="bold">right-clicked</span>. When user selects a menu item from the context menu, 
        the <span class="bold">Execute</span> method of a diagram element action gets called.</p>

    <img src="../image/diagram_element_action.png"/>

    <h3>
        Diagram Actions
    </h3>

    <p>
        Actions derived from the <span class="bold">DiagramAction</span> are added to a context menu by the <span class="bold">AddActions</span> method of a selection when 
        it is <span class="bold">right-clicked</span>. When user selects a menu item from the context menu, 
        the <span class="bold">Execute</span> method of a diagram action gets called.</p>
    </p>
